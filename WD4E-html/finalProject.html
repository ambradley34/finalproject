    <p>Hi everyone. I have an M.S. in Marine Biology and here are some of my favorite creatures from the deep. These creatures were obtained on a research cruise and are very valuable samples. It's not everyday that you can see animals like this so please enjoy. I've included a link to MBARI for further reading on animals like this.</p>
